Hello, I'm Josh. I'm a pretty nerdy person. I've done UI work in the past, though
currently I'm doing devops work. This site is a nice front for all the other stuff
I do around the web.

This page uses some other fancy stuff that I've learned how to use - such as
Twitter Bootstrap. Also, I've never really gotten very proficient at CSS up to
this point, so I figure it's time I actually become half decent at it...

Anyways, have a look around. There's probably not going to be a whole lot of
actual content here, but it's a good place to find links to most of the rest of
my online presence. (and it's lightyears ahead of what I'd hacked together in
vim before...)
