Hello, I'm Josh. I'm not your average fresh-out-of-school computer
programmer. As you patiently waited for this page to load, my VPS worked hard
using technologies such as Markdown and PHP to render this page for you. The
text that you are reading here is written in Markdown, and converted to HTML in
real time through a PHP `shell_exec`.
 
This page uses some other fancy stuff that I've learned how to use - such as
Twitter Bootstrap. Also, I've never really gotten very proficient at CSS up to
this point, so I figure it's time I actually become half decent at it...

Anyways, have a look around. There's probably not going to be a whole lot of
actual content here, but it's a good place to find links to most of the rest of
my online presence. (and it's lightyears ahead of what I'd hacked together in
vim before...)
