Hello, I'm Josh. I'm not your average CS major. As you patiently
waited for this page to load, my VPS worked hard using technologies
such as Markdown and PHP to render this page for you. The text that
you are reading here is written in Markdown, and converted to HTML in
real time through PHP. (PHP is just doing a `shell_exec` on markdown,
which returns html and gets echoed back out to the client.) 

This page uses some other fancy stuff that I'm learning how to use -
such as Twitter Bootstrap. Also, I've never really learned CSS up to
this point, so I figure it's time I actually figure that out. 

Anyways, have a look around. There's probably not going to be a whole
lot here, but I decided I wanted something fancier than the 4-line
page I hacked up in vim. :P
