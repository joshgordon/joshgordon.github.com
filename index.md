Hello, I'm Josh. I'm a pretty nerdy person. I've done UI work in the past, though
currently I'm doing devops work. This site is a nice front for all the other stuff
I do around the web, and a nice place to use as a sandbox for testing out shiny
new stuff.

**NEW** This site is no longer rendered with a php `shell_exec`, I've gone ahead and
migrated it all to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which I'm probably going to
do for all my other sites that are using PHP as a templating engine.

Anyways, have a look around. There's probably not going to be a whole lot of
actual content here, but it's a good place to find links to most of the rest of
my online presence. (and it's lightyears ahead of what I'd hacked together in
vim before...)
