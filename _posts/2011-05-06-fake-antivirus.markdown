I was poking around Facebook when I saw <a href="http://howtogeek.com">How-To Geek</a> post <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/what-a-mac-malware-attack-looks-like/3269">this link</a> to a thing about fake antivirus for Mac OSX. I was curious what the attack would look like on my Linux machine.

I Googled the same thing they did, and found the same picture they did. (Mine was on page 5, but I found it anyways.)

Turns out whoever set this up wasn't clever enough to set up an attack for Linux. :)

This is what I got.

After I clicked OK, it did a brief "scan," and told me I had a bunch of viruses.

If you click "Remove all," "Cancel," or the red X, it tries to download software on your machine.

Of course, this story has a moral. <strong>NEVER DOWNLOAD ANTIVIRUS FROM SOMEWHERE YOU DON'T TRUST! </strong>

This means you shouldn't trust those ads that say "You're computer has 20 bazillion virusses! Download new Antivirus now!" <strong>
</strong>

Here's a list of antivirus that I have some level of trust in:
<ul>
	<li>AVG</li>
	<li>Avast</li>
	<li>Microsoft security essentials</li>
</ul>
If you're buying AV at a brick and mortar store (or even Amazon!) there's a good chance it's legitimate and not fake.

Better than all of these options -- Just run Linux!
