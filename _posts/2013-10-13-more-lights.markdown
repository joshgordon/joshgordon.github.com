Hello few-and-far-between readers.

I have a new update about my lights. I have moved out of campus housing this fall, and have a bit more space for nice things such as lights.

As of right now, I have 3 strings of lights:
1. Above my window
2. Behind my desk, pointed at the wall
3. under each of my monitors [These are white and not RGB...]

I finally got around to getting lights into my new desk, and I must say they're now quite nice.

I'll post a few more pics of the build process when I get some more time, but I'll leave you with that for now. (I have 3 exams this coming week and need to catch some sleep!)

P.S. As with before, the code is on <a href="https://github.com/joshgordon/pyLights">Github</a>. I still have no fading in the web interface, but finally have the white lights in...
