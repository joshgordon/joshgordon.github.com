So I decided to jump on the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) bandwagon. This blog is now being hosted on Ghost. 

Also, in the process I'm switching my VPS from Fedora to Arch, since Arch has a rolling release so I won't have to take time and do a version upgrade twice a year. 

Thought I'd just drop that there. Bye!
