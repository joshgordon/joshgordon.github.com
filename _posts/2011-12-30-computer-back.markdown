So very nice to have a nice computer again. I was getting tired of my old, slow, hot, little-to-no-battery-life 5.5 year old laptop that someone gave me for free...

It served its purpose just fine, but I can honestly say I never want to go back to using it as my everyday machine... :)

On another note, I'm hoping to start posting more stuff here. As always, tell me what you think. :)
