If you've read through the last 2 dozen posts here, you know that almost exactly 2 years ago my logic board started to fail and I had it replace. This happened again - but this time in a different way. 

# Graphics Failure 
Yay. (not)

My screen had lines on it during the boot process, then it bluescreened on me. 

Thankfully, the Apple Store was able to repair it for a Tier 2 Flat fee. (AKA, they didn't deem it accidental.) Much cheaper than a new computer! 

Only strage thing is that they took out my 16 gigs of ram and replaced it with 8. Thankfully, they gave me back my memory sticks, so I'll have to open it up and get that working again.
