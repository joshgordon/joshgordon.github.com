So I decided that my favorite xkcd comic (#627:Â http://xkcd.com/627/) was missing a few things. I decided to spice it up a bit with a few extra things.

After an hour in photoshop, I came out with this:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-110" title="If you cannot read this hovertext, find the nearest person and see if they can." src="http://joshgordon.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tech_support_cheat_sheet_recursive.png" alt="If you cannot read this hovertext, find the nearest person and see if they can." width="732" height="823" />

Credit goes to Randall Munroe for creating the original strip. Also, thanks to <a href="http://xkcdsucks.blogspot.com/2009/03/xkcdsucks-is-proud-to-present-humor.html">these folks</a> for the xkcd handwriting font.
