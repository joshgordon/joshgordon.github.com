I'm done with blogger. It doesn't have nearly enough control for me. :p (Sorry, I'm a techie control freak!)

On another note, I found x10 hosting. Free. Only one problem for me - they want me to let them take over my domain's name servers, something which I'm unwilling to do... (I still have subdomains point various other places...) So, for the time being I'm going to cheat, stick another copy of wordpress over there, and keep some stuff on it. (Backups, mostly! Shhh, don't tell!)

I might eventually Â get another domain, and switch that one to be hosted by them, but for now I'm still leeching off of my Parents' hosting service. Works great for me! :D

'till later,

Josh
