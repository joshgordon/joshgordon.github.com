<p style="margin: 1.2em 0px ! important;">A few months ago, I discovered <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c0167ae9a50a">Digital Ocean</a>, which is the cheapest VPS provider I’ve ever found. I’m now paying $5 a month for 1 CPU core, 512 mb of RAM, and 20 GB of SSD space, as well as 1TB of transfer. Plenty for my needs!</p>
<p style="margin: 1.2em 0px ! important;">Anyways, I’ve moved most of the stuff I’m hosting over to my VPS there, which is nice - because I have complete control over the HTTP server, unlike with bluehost.</p>
<p style="margin: 1.2em 0px ! important;">But anyways, beyond that, I just finished hacking a small project together. One of my roommates introduced me to <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">Diceware</a>, which is intended to take a series of dice rolls and convert them into reasonably secure passwords. I remembered from playing around with it a bit that my Raspberry Pi has a Hardware Random Number Generator on it, so I decided to take advantage of it and write some code to generate passwords.</p>
<p style="margin: 1.2em 0px ! important;">Enter Node.js. Using my very tiny knowledge of Javascript and Node.js, I managed to hack together in less than 3 hours a <a href="https://github.com/joshgordon/rng_password_generator">working script</a>. Note that you’ll be on your own (for now) to get hwrng working on the raspberry pi. (not that hard!)</p>
<p style="margin: 1.2em 0px ! important;">Anyways, it defaults to using port 9000, and without an argument, will currently give you 0 words for your passphrase. You’ll have to give it some form of argument (e.g. pi:9000/5 for 5 words.)</p>
<p style="margin: 1.2em 0px ! important;">I hope to have it serving HTTPS at some point, but for now HTTP is good enough for my purposes.</p>
