I'm getting really excited about the upcoming release of Natty Narwhal. Since Beta 2 comes out tomorrow (14th), I'm probably going to grab that and wipe my laptop over the weekend... Hopefully I won't have too many issues.

On another note, I just upgrade my website from Weebly, to Wordpress. Over the next few <del>days</del> weeks I'll try to move content back into Wordpress... I did this because I could do everything I wanted with Wordpress (which I've been running for years on our intranet...), and I liked the interface much better.

'Till later,

Josh
