If you know me at all, you know I'm a **HUGE** Switchfoot fan. By far, though,
my favorite song is the one that, as Jon Foreman puts it (paraphrasing, it's
been nearly a year since I saw them last... Feeling the withdrawl... ok, maybe
not) "talks about the place with no more tears, no more pain, and no more
suffereing." 

As I'm sure many people do, I have a journal. Sometimes I even write in it. (I
swear I actually spend more time reading through old entries than I do writing
new ones...) After I saw Switchfoot last, sorry, the December before last (has
it been that long?), I wrote some comments about this song, seeing as it's
pretty much my favorite song ever. I would go get my journal and quote some of
it from that night, but my journal is in my car's trunk, it's waaay to cold
out, and it's getting too late for me to be willing to get it. Anyways, that
distracts from the point. I said something about liking this song for the
"mindset of eternity" that it has. I thought nothing of it at the time. 

Several weeks/months later I was reading through my old journal entries (see
parenthetical statement from last paragraph) and stumbled upon those words
again. "Mindset of eternity", I thought, "that's a mindset I want to be in a
lot more". Then I proceeded to write a paragraph about my thoughts. (is that a
paragraph about my thoughts about my thoughts? Maybe I'd better start doing
[meta-meta-journaling](https://blog.joshgordon.net/mindset-of-eternity/)...
Then again, I suppose that's what this paragraph is... Time to move onto
[meta-meta-meta-journaling](http://xkcd.com/1447/)...) 

> Until I die I'll sing these songs  
> On the shores of Babylon  
> Still looking for a home  
> In a world where I belong
> 
> Where the weak are finally strong  
> Where the righteous right the wrongs  
> Still looking for a home  
> In a world where I belong
> 
> This body's not my own  
> This world is not my own  
> But I still can hear the sound  
> Of my heart beating out  
> So let's go boys, play it loud
> 
> On the final day I die  
> I want to hold my head up high  
> I want to tell You that I tried  
> To live it like a song
> 
> And when I reach the other side  
> I want to look You in the eye  
> And know that I've arrived  
> In a world where I belong

If you've never heard "Where I Belong" by Switchfoot, I encourage you to go
give it a listen. Pay close attention to the lyrics. 

How would the world look if everyone - or even just Christians - thought about
everything with a mindset like that? I know that a lot of choices I make in my
life would look very different.
