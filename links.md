# Presentations
- [Git and other Version Control Systems (pdf)](./git_vcs.pdf) - This is a 
  presentation that I gave for my Scripting Languages class at [UMBC](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/undergraduate/433/spring2014/). 
  I decided that Version Control systems are an integral part of most 
  programming jobs, and that the average student doesn't really understand 
  their usefulness. 

# Developer
- [My Pebble App](http://pblweb.com/appstore/530a781e24c458af7d00011e) - I 
  was unhappy with the default binary watchface that came with the pebble, 
  so I changed a little bit around and now it's better. 

# Humor
- [WAT?](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) - This is a humorous
  video that pokes fun at Javascript and Ruby - specifically about some of
  the *stranger* features of these languages. 

# Reference
- [Google Geochart API](https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart) (I used this for the map on my [map](map.php) page.)
